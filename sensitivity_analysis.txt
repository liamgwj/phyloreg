Observation: using logistic regression to predict the probability of two hosts sharing a pathogen given the PD separating them relies on '0' observations being true non-associations

In the case where '0's are assumed rather than measured, the model predictions are likely to be influenced by the number and/or distribution of '0' "observations" that are included

We want to assess the potential variation in model predictions under different false-zero situations



Method:

start with Robles (code available) then Gilbert (bigger reach)


1. reproduce published analysis (logistic regression portion only). This will include some number of '0' observations.

2. re-run analysis with successively fewer, then more '0' observations, writing out slopes/predictions at each step.

3. compare outputs of varied models
